# Electric field

The vector field generated by collection of fixed electrical charges, as
dictated by Coulomb's law. This function is mainly used to provide
examples for visualizing vector fields with ggvfields.

## Usage

``` r
efield(u, charge_positions, charges, k = 1, q_test = +1, log = FALSE)

efield_maker(
  charge_positions = rbind(c(-1, -1), c(1, 1)),
  charges = c(-1, +1),
  k = 1,
  q_test = +1,
  log = FALSE
)
```

## Arguments

- u:

  The position of the test charge.

- charge_positions:

  The positions of the fixed charges generating the electric field.
  Defaulted in `efield_maker()`.

- charges:

  The charges of the points placed at the positions of charge_positions.
  Defaulted in `efield_maker()`.

- k:

  The constant of proportionality, defaulted to 1. See examples for a
  more rigorous use of physical constants.

- q_test:

  The test charge, defaulted to +1.

- log:

  Executes the transformation of the double log of the norm of the
  vectors.

## Value

A vector containing the force felt by the test charge on account of the
electric field.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
# set a - charge at (-1,-1) and a + charge at (1,1)
charge_positions <- rbind(c(-1,-1), c(1,1))
charges <- c(-1, +1)


# calculate force on test charge (+1) at c(0,1), ignoring physical constants
efield(c(0,1), charge_positions, charges)


# efield_maker() simply wraps this function, defaulting to those charges
f <- efield_maker()
f(c(0,1))

ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, xlim = c(-2,2), ylim = c(-2,2)) +
  scale_color_viridis_c(trans = "log10")

# electric constant from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_permittivity
ep0 <- 8.854187818814e-12
k <- (4*pi*ep0)^-1
efield(c(0,1), charge_positions, charges, k)
} # }
```
