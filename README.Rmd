**ggvfields** extends [**ggplot2**](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2) by providing suite of tools to visualize vector and stream fields. In addition to standard vector and stream plotting, **ggvfields** automatically computes and visualizes smoothed vector fields, smooth gradient fields, gradient fields derived from scalar functions, and potential fields from gradients. This integrated framework simplifies the analysis and interpretation of complex vector and scalar field data.

A manuscript describing the theoretical foundations and detailed methodologies behind ggvfields is forthcoming.

## Core Features

### `geom_vector_field()` and `geom_vector_field2()`

- **`geom_vector_field()`**: Computes vector fields from a user-defined function over the domain $\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : -1 < x < 1,\ -1 < y < 1\}$ on an $n \times n$ grid (default: $11 \times 11$) and maps the norm to color. Vectors are centered and normalized by default.

The norm $\mathbf{w} = (u, v)$ is calculated $$|\mathbf{w}| = \sqrt{u^2 + v^2}$$ .

```{r}
f <- function(v) c(-v[2], v[1]) # Define a function for the field

ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(fun = f) 
```

- **`geom_vector_field2()`**: Similar to `geom_vector_field()`, but maps the norm of vectors to their lengths instead of color.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field2(fun = f) 
```

**Why Length Mapping Matters**

Mapping vector lengths to their norms allows viewers to immediately understand magnitude differences without relying solely on color.  This feature of `geom_vector2()` enhances interpretability by using actual vector lengths to represent magnitude. The legend reflects the scaling and ensures correct interpretation.

- **`geom_vector_field()` options**

**Length**

We can set the `L` parameter to visualize vectors at a specified length. 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(fun = f, n = 4, L = 2) 
```

**Center**

By default, all vectors are centered on their origin.  We can turn off centering.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(fun = f, n = 4, center = FALSE) 
```

**normalize**

If we turn off normalization and centering, we get a raw look at the vector field data.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(fun = f, n = 4, normalize = FALSE, center = FALSE) 
```

### `geom_stream_field()` and `geom_stream_field2()`

- **`geom_stream_field()`**: Computes stream fields from a user-defined function and maps the average speed to color.
Average speed is the overall rate at which a particle traverses the shown stream. If the displacement vector has length $|\mathbf{d}|$ and it takes time $t$, the integration time of streams, to traverse that distance, then the average speed is given by $\text{Average Speed} = \frac{|\mathbf{d}|}{t}$

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f) 
```

- **`geom_stream_field2()`**: Similar to `geom_stream_field()`, but removes mapping, arrow heads, and designates stream origins with a dot.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field2(fun = f) 
```

- **`geom_stream_field()` options**

`geom_stream_field()` maintains similar options to `geom_vector_field()`.  Some arguments yield slightly different behavior.

**Length**

By adjusting the `L` parameter, we can control the length of each stream.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, n = 4, L = .8) 
```

**Normalization**

By default, the lengths of each stream is normalized to be the same length.  By turning normalization off, each stream becomes time normalized.  In other words, each stream grows for the same amount of time. 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, n = 4, normalize = FALSE) 
```

We can control the length of the longest stream when `normalize = FALSE` by altering the `L` argument. 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, n = 4, normalize = FALSE, L = .8) 
```

**Time**

When `normalize = FALSE`, we can grow each stream for the same amount of time by using the `T` parameter. 

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, n = 4, normalize = FALSE, T = .5) 
```


### `geom_gradient_field()` and `geom_gradient_field2()`
  
The `geom_gradient_field()` function computes and visualizes gradient fields derived from scalar functions and displays the gradient vector field of a scalar function, $f(x, y)$. The gradient is given by:

$$
\nabla f(x, y) = \left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right)
$$

This vector field points in the direction of the greatest rate of increase of the scalar function. The function numerically evaluates these partial derivatives and visualizes the resulting vectors.

- **Gradient Fields as Vectors** The resulting vector field has all the same defaults and same options as `geom_vector_field()`
  
```{r}
field <- function(v) {
  x <- v[1]
  y <- v[2]
  x^3 + y^3
}

ggplot() +
  geom_gradient_field(fun = field)
```

- **Gradient Fields as Streams** The resulting stream field has all the same defaults and same options as `geom_stream_field()`

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_gradient_field(fun = field, type = "stream")
```

### `geom_potential()`
  
A potential function represents a scalar field whose gradient produces a vector field. It is used to describe conservative vector fields which exist when the curl of the vector field is 0.  

The `geom_potential()` function computes and visualizes the scalar potential function for a given conservative vector field. The input function must represent a 2D vector field and the output is the corresponding potential function. If the input field is not conservative, the function checks this condition numerically based on a tolerance parameter. The tolerance determines how strictly the field must satisfy the conservation condition.

```{r}
conservative_fun <- function(v) {
 x <- v[1]
 y <- v[2]
 c(sin(x) + y, x - sin(y))
}

ggplot() +
  geom_potential(fun = conservative_fun, xlim = c(-2*pi, 2*pi), ylim = c(-2*pi, 2*pi))
```

The `tol` parameter can be adjusted to control the sensitivity of the conservativeness check. Decreasing the tolerance makes the check stricter, while increasing it allows for more numerical error.  You can turn this functionality on with `verify_conservative = TRUE`.

```{r}
non_conservative_fun <- function(v) {
 x <- v[1]
 y <- v[2]
 c(-y, x)
}

ggplot() +
  geom_potential(fun = non_conservative_fun, 
                 xlim = c(-2*pi, 2*pi), ylim = c(-2*pi, 2*pi), 
                 verify_conservative = TRUE,
                 tol = 1e-6
                 )
```

### `geom_vector()` and `geom_vector2()`

So far, these layers have supported visualizing functions.  **ggvfields** can also visualize raw data.

Generate sample wind data:
  
```{r}
set.seed(1234)
n <- 10

wind_data <- data.frame(
  lon = rnorm(n), 
  lat = rnorm(n), 
  dir = runif(n, -pi/2, pi/2),
  spd = rchisq(n, df = 2)
) |> 
  within({
    fx    <- spd * cos(dir)          # Compute the x-component of the vector
    fy    <- spd * sin(dir)          # Compute the y-component of the vector
    xend  <- lon + fx                # Compute the end x-coordinate
    yend  <- lat + fy                # Compute the end y-coordinate
  })

round(wind_data, digits = 2) |> head(6)
```


- **`geom_vector()`**: By default, this maps the norm (magnitude) of a vector to its color.  

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, xend = xend, yend = yend)) 
```

`geom_vector()` also supports both `xend`/`yend` format as well as `fx`/`fy` format.

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) 
```

- **`geom_vector2()`**: Maps the norm of a vector directly to its length.  This provides a more intuitive representation of magnitude. This is done by mapping `length = after_stat(norm)` by default.

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector2(aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) 
```

**Polar Coordinates Support**

Both `geom_vector()` and `geom_vector2()` also support polar coordinates, where vectors are specified using magnitude (`distance`) and direction (`angle`). Instead of providing Cartesian components (`fx`, `fy` or `xend`, `yend`), users can directly supply polar data. This feature simplifies workflows for directional data and works  for all subsequent relevant functions that handle polar coordinates.

Polar coordinates can be visualized like this:

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, distance = spd, angle = dir)) 
```

**Normalize and Center**

- `normalize`: When set to `TRUE`, this option scales each vector to have a unit length, which can help avoid overplotting in dense vector fields. This is especially useful when the direction of vectors is more important than their magnitude. However, it’s important to note that normalize is different from mapping the norm of the vector to the length aesthetic. While normalization ensures that all vectors are visually uniform in length, mapping the norm to length preserves the relative differences in magnitude by varying the vector lengths based on their actual norms.

- `center`: By default, `center` is also set to `TRUE`, meaning the midpoint of each vector is placed at the corresponding (`x`, `y`) coordinate, effectively "centering" the vector on the point. When center is `FALSE`, the base of the vector is anchored at the (`x`, `y`) point, and the vector extends outward from there. 

The example below turns off this default behavior:

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy), center = FALSE, normalize = FALSE) 
```

## Modeling Features

**ggvfields** offers techniques for smoothing noisy vector field data `geom_stream_smooth()` and `geom_vector_smooth()`

`geom_stream_smooth()` uses a dynamical systems approach and `geom_vector_smooth()` offers a multivariate regression approach that accounts for uncertainty. 

### `geom_stream_smooth()`

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector(alpha = .5, color = "black") +
  geom_stream_smooth(aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) 
```

### `geom_vector_smooth()`
  
Provides smoothed estimates of vector fields by applying statistical techniques to observed vectors.

Smoothing is performed using a multivariate linear model defined by:

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
\hat{dx} \\
\hat{dy}
\end{pmatrix} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \beta_2 y + \beta_3 xy
$$

where $\beta$ are coefficients estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS). This approach captures linear and interaction effects to approximate the underlying vector field.  This function also creates a prediction interval around the vector specified by the `conf_level` argument and defaults to `.95`.

- **Evaluating Specific Points**:

When evaluation points are provided, smoothing is performed at those locations and prediction intervals can be visualized using either wedges or ellipses to indicate uncertainty.

```{r}
eval_point <- data.frame(x = .5, y = .5) 

ggplot(wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector(normalize = FALSE) +
  geom_vector_smooth(eval_points = eval_point) +
  lims(x = c(-7,10), y = c(-3,3))
```

- **Using Wedges to Visualize Uncertainty**:

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector(normalize = FALSE) +
  geom_vector_smooth(eval_points = eval_point, pi_type = "wedge") 
```

- **Grid-Based Smoothing**:
  
```{r}
ggplot(wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector_smooth(pi_type = "wedge") + 
  geom_vector() 
```

- **Custom Grid Resolution**:
  
```{r}
ggplot(wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector_smooth(n = 6, pi_type = "wedge") 
```

- **Altering Confidence Level**

For all options, you can change the confidence level from the default to another value by using the `conf_level` argument. 

```{r}
ggplot(wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector(normalize = FALSE) +
  geom_vector_smooth(eval_points = eval_point, pi_type = "wedge") +
  geom_vector_smooth(eval_points = eval_point, pi_type = "wedge", conf_level = .7) 
```

### `geom_gradient_smooth()`

`geom_gradient_smooth()` creates a **smoothed gradient field** from raw scalar data using a fitted linear model. This function estimates gradients when only scalar values (`z`) are observed at spatial locations (`x`, `y`). It is designed for cases where you have scalar data and wish to estimate the gradient.

The gradients are computed numerically from a fitted scalar field model and the resulting gradient vectors are visualized using either streamlines or vector arrows.

```{r}
f1 <- function(u) {
  x <- u[1]
  y <- u[2]
  x^2 - y^2
}

grid_data <- expand.grid(
  x = seq(-5, 5, length.out = 30),
  y = seq(-5, 5, length.out = 30)
)

set.seed(123)
grid_data$z <- apply(grid_data, 1, f1) + rnorm(nrow(grid_data), mean = 0, sd = 5)

ggplot(grid_data, aes(x = x, y = y, z = z)) +
  geom_gradient_smooth()
```

To illustrate how `geom_gradient_smooth()` can adapt to nonlinear surfaces, we can change the formula used to fit the scalar field and switch to a streamline visualization using `type = "stream"`. The example below uses a smooth but noisy scalar function that generates curved gradients and fits a flexible smoothing model to capture these variations.


```{r}
h1 <- function(u) {
  x <- u[1]
  y <- u[2]
  sin(x / 2) * cos(y / 2)
}

grid_data$z <- apply(grid_data, 1, h1) + rnorm(nrow(grid_data), mean = 0, sd = 1)

ggplot(grid_data, aes(x = x, y = y, z = z)) +
  geom_gradient_smooth(formula = z ~ I(x^2) * I(y^2), n = 5, type = "stream") 

```

## Other Features

### Automatic Limit Detection

These functions can automatically determine plot limits based on the function provided. This happens when data exists in previous layers or in the base ggplot object.  This allows the limits to be inferred from context. Customize limits with the `xlim` and `ylim` parameters if needed for more control.

```{r}
ggplot(data = wind_data, aes(x = lon, y = lat, fx = fx, fy = fy)) +
  geom_vector() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f) # Automatically determines limits based on existing data

```

### Custom Grids

The `geom_*_field` functions allow the user to plot with custom evaluation locations.  The user can specify specific points to be evaluated over the field or can also use a "hex" pattern.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, grid = "hex")
```

This shows a custom grid.

```{r}
custom <- data.frame(x = c(1,3,5), y = c(3,4,5))

ggplot() +
  geom_stream_field(fun = f, grid = custom, normalize = FALSE, center = FALSE, L = 4)
```
