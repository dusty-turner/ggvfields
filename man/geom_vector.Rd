\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat}
argument can be used the override the default coupling between geoms and
stats. The \code{stat} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}'s \code{params} argument. These
arguments broadly fall into one of 4 categories below. Notably, further
arguments to the \code{position} argument, or aesthetics that are required
can \emph{not} be passed through \code{...}. Unknown arguments that are not part
of the 4 categories below are ignored.
\itemize{
\item Static aesthetics that are not mapped to a scale, but are at a fixed
value and apply to the layer as a whole. For example, \code{colour = "red"}
or \code{linewidth = 3}. The geom's documentation has an \strong{Aesthetics}
section that lists the available options. The 'required' aesthetics
cannot be passed on to the \code{params}. Please note that while passing
unmapped aesthetics as vectors is technically possible, the order and
required length is not guaranteed to be parallel to the input data.
\item When constructing a layer using
a \verb{stat_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on
parameters to the \code{geom} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{stat_density(geom = "area", outline.type = "both")}. The geom's
documentation lists which parameters it can accept.
\item Inversely, when constructing a layer using a
\verb{geom_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{stat} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{geom_area(stat = "density", adjust = 0.5)}. The stat's documentation
lists which parameters it can accept.
\item The \code{key_glyph} argument of \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}} may also be passed on through
\code{...}. This can be one of the functions described as
\link[ggplot2:draw_key]{key glyphs}, to change the display of the layer in the legend.
}}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification for adding arrowheads to vectors, created with
\code{grid::arrow()}. Controls arrowhead angle, length, and type.
Setting \code{arrow = NULL} will remove arrowheads.}

\item{center}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, the vector is centered on the (\code{x}, \code{y}) location.
If \code{FALSE}, the vector originates at the (\code{x}, \code{y}) location. When centered, the
midpoint of the vector aligns with the original (\code{x}, \code{y}) position.}

\item{normalize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, normalizes each vector to a unit length before
applying any scaling. This can help prevent overplotting in dense plots and
ensures consistent visual representation.}

\item{tail_point}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adds a point at the tail of each vector to mark
the starting position more clearly.}

\item{eval_point}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adds a point at the evaluation end (or midpoint if centered)
of each vector to mark the target or midpoint position more clearly.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use to display the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{stat_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{geom} argument
can be used to override the default coupling between stats and geoms. The
\code{geom} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Geom} ggproto subclass, for example \code{GeomPoint}.
\item A string naming the geom. To give the geom as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{geom_} prefix. For example, to use \code{geom_point()},
give the geom as \code{"point"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the geom, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_geoms]{layer geom} documentation.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} layer that can be added to a ggplot object to produce a vector plot.
}
\description{
\code{geom_vector()} generates a ggplot layer that visualizes vectors as line segments
with optional arrowheads. Vectors are defined by their start coordinates (\code{x}, \code{y})
and either directional components (\code{dx}, \code{dy}) or polar coordinates (\code{angle} and \code{distance}).
}
\details{
This geom is designed for situations where the vector data is already available
(e.g., wind directions and speeds at known locations). If you need to generate
a vector field from a user-defined function over a specified grid (which can
compute \code{divergence} and \code{curl}), consider using \code{\link[=geom_vector_field]{geom_vector_field()}}.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_vector()} understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in \strong{bold}):
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{x}}: The x-coordinate of the vector's start (or center) point.
\item \strong{\code{y}}: The y-coordinate of the vector's start (or center) point.
\item \strong{\code{dx}}: The vector's x-component of displacement.
\item \strong{\code{dy}}: The vector's y-component of displacement.
\item \code{angle} (in radians): The angle of the vector, used with \code{distance}.
\item \code{distance}: The magnitude of the vector, used with \code{angle}.
\item \code{length}: The displayed length of the vector on the plot. By default, the vector
is drawn at its actual data-defined size. To modify this, you can:
\itemize{
\item Assign a constant length: \code{aes(length = 0.5)} (for example).
\item Scale length by a computed statistic, such as \code{aes(length = after_stat(norm))} to
represent the vector's magnitude.
}
\item \code{color}: By default, \code{color = after_stat(norm)} to map the magnitude of each vector
to its color, providing a visual cue of vector strength.
\item \code{fill}: Fill color for arrowheads and tail points.
\item \code{linewidth}: The thickness of the vector line.
\item \code{linetype}: The type of line (e.g., solid, dashed).
\item \code{alpha}: The transparency level of the vector.
}
}

\section{Key Notes}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{Default Color Mapping}:
\itemize{
\item The default maps vector magnitude (\code{norm}) to \code{color}.
\item This makes stronger (longer) vectors more visually prominent.
\item To override this behavior, specify \code{aes(color = "black")} or another fixed color.
}
\item \strong{Scaling by Length}:
\itemize{
\item By default, vectors are drawn at their data-defined size.
\item To scale by the vector's magnitude, use \code{aes(length = after_stat(norm))}.
\item For a shortcut, \code{geom_vector2()} automatically maps magnitude to length.
}
}
}

\section{Computed Variables}{

\code{geom_vector()} computes:
\itemize{
\item \code{norm}: The magnitude of each vector, \eqn{\sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}}.
}
}

  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, angle = wind_dir, distance = wind_spd))

# To scale vector length by magnitude, use geom_vector2()
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector2(aes(x = lon, y = lat, dx = dx, dy = dy))

# Manually map length to norm
