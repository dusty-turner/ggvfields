\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat}
argument can be used the override the default coupling between geoms and
stats. The \code{stat} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed on to \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}}'s \code{params} argument. These
arguments broadly fall into one of 4 categories below. Notably, further
arguments to the \code{position} argument, or aesthetics that are required
can \emph{not} be passed through \code{...}. Unknown arguments that are not part
of the 4 categories below are ignored.
\itemize{
\item Static aesthetics that are not mapped to a scale, but are at a fixed
value and apply to the layer as a whole. For example, \code{colour = "red"}
or \code{linewidth = 3}. The geom's documentation has an \strong{Aesthetics}
section that lists the available options. The 'required' aesthetics
cannot be passed on to the \code{params}. Please note that while passing
unmapped aesthetics as vectors is technically possible, the order and
required length is not guaranteed to be parallel to the input data.
\item When constructing a layer using
a \verb{stat_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on
parameters to the \code{geom} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{stat_density(geom = "area", outline.type = "both")}. The geom's
documentation lists which parameters it can accept.
\item Inversely, when constructing a layer using a
\verb{geom_*()} function, the \code{...} argument can be used to pass on parameters
to the \code{stat} part of the layer. An example of this is
\code{geom_area(stat = "density", adjust = 0.5)}. The stat's documentation
lists which parameters it can accept.
\item The \code{key_glyph} argument of \code{\link[ggplot2:layer]{layer()}} may also be passed on through
\code{...}. This can be one of the functions described as
\link[ggplot2:draw_key]{key glyphs}, to change the display of the layer in the legend.
}}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification for vector arrowheads, created with \code{grid::arrow()}.
Controls the appearance of arrowheads, including angle, length, and type.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{center}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, centers the vector on the specified (\code{x}, \code{y}) location.
If \code{FALSE}, the vector starts at the specified (\code{x}, \code{y}) point. When centering is enabled,
the vector's midpoint aligns with the original (\code{x}, \code{y}) location.}

\item{normalize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, normalizes each vector to a unit length before applying any scaling.
This prevents overplotting and ensures consistent visual presentation in dense plots.}

\item{tail_point}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, adds a point to mark the tail of each vector.}

\item{tail_point.size}{Integer; sets the size of the tail point if \code{tail_point = TRUE}.}

\item{fun}{A function applied to vector data if additional transformations are needed.}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use to display the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{stat_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{geom} argument
can be used to override the default coupling between stats and geoms. The
\code{geom} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Geom} ggproto subclass, for example \code{GeomPoint}.
\item A string naming the geom. To give the geom as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{geom_} prefix. For example, to use \code{geom_point()},
give the geom as \code{"point"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the geom, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_geoms]{layer geom} documentation.
}}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} layer that can be added to a ggplot object to produce a vector plot.
}
\description{
\code{geom_vector} generates a ggplot layer that visualizes vectors as line
segments with optional arrowheads. Vectors are defined by their start (\code{x}, \code{y})
and directional components (\code{dx}, \code{dy}), which indicate the change in position.
Alternatively, vectors can be defined by angular (\code{angle}) and distance (\code{distance}) information.
}
\section{Aesthetics}{

\code{geom_vector} understands the following aesthetics (required aesthetics are in \strong{bold}):
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{x}}: x-coordinate of the start point of the vector.
\item \strong{\code{y}}: y-coordinate of the start point of the vector.
\item \strong{\code{dx}}: Change in the x-direction (length component along the x-axis).
\item \strong{\code{dy}}: Change in the y-direction (length component along the y-axis).
\item \code{angle}: The angle of the vector in degrees (optional, used with \code{distance}).
\item \code{distance}: The magnitude of the vector (optional, used with \code{angle}).
\item \code{length}: Length of the vector (default: \code{after_stat(NA)}).
\itemize{
\item You can also manually scale vector length by using \code{aes(length = after_stat(norm))}.
\item Alternatively, use \code{geom_vector2()} to map vector magnitude (\code{norm}) to length automatically.
}
\item \code{color}: \strong{By default, \code{color = after_stat(norm)}} to reflect vector magnitude.
\item \code{fill}: Fill color for arrowheads and points.
\item \code{linewidth}: Thickness of the vector line.
\item \code{linetype}: Type of line (solid, dashed, etc.).
\item \code{alpha}: Transparency level of the vector.
\item \code{arrow}: Arrowhead specification for the vector.
}
}

\section{Key Notes}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{Default Color Mapping}:
\itemize{
\item The default behavior maps the vector's magnitude (\code{norm}) to the \code{color} aesthetic.
\item This ensures that vector strength is visually emphasized through color.
\item To override this behavior, you can set \code{aes(color = "black")} or another fixed color.
}
\item \strong{Scaling by Length}:
\itemize{
\item By default, vector length is not scaled (\code{length = after_stat(NA)}).
\item You can manually enable length scaling by using \code{aes(length = after_stat(norm))}.
\item Alternatively, use the \code{geom_vector2()} function for automatic length scaling based on magnitude.
}
}

\section{Computed Variables}{

\describe{
\item{norm}{The magnitude of each vector, calculated as \eqn{\|\mathbf{v}\| = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}}.}
}
}

\examples{
set.seed(1234)
n <- 10
wind_data <- data.frame(
  lon = rnorm(n),
  lat = rnorm(n),
  wind_dir = runif(n, -pi, pi),
  wind_spd = rchisq(n, df = 2),
  dx = rchisq(n, df = 2) * cos(runif(n, -pi, pi)),
  dy = rchisq(n, df = 2) * sin(runif(n, -pi, pi))
)

ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, dx = dx, dy = dy))

# Example using Polar coordinates: angle and distance
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, angle = wind_dir, distance = wind_spd))

# To scale vector length by magnitude, use geom_vector2():
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector2(aes(x = lon, y = lat, dx = dx, dy = dy))

# Or manually set length mapping with after_stat():
ggplot(wind_data) +
  geom_vector(aes(x = lon, y = lat, dx = dx, dy = dy, length = after_stat(norm)))
