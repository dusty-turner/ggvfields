\arguments{
\item{mapping}{Set of aesthetic mappings created by \code{\link[ggplot2:aes]{aes()}}. If specified and
\code{inherit.aes = TRUE} (the default), it is combined with the default mapping
at the top level of the plot. You must supply \code{mapping} if there is no plot
mapping.}

\item{data}{The data to be displayed in this layer. There are three
options:

If \code{NULL}, the default, the data is inherited from the plot
data as specified in the call to \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot()}}.

A \code{data.frame}, or other object, will override the plot
data. All objects will be fortified to produce a data frame. See
\code{\link[ggplot2:fortify]{fortify()}} for which variables will be created.

A \code{function} will be called with a single argument,
the plot data. The return value must be a \code{data.frame}, and
will be used as the layer data. A \code{function} can be created
from a \code{formula} (e.g. \code{~ head(.x, 10)}).}

\item{stat}{The statistical transformation to use on the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{geom_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{stat}
argument can be used the override the default coupling between geoms and
stats. The \code{stat} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Stat} ggproto subclass, for example \code{StatCount}.
\item A string naming the stat. To give the stat as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{stat_} prefix. For example, to use \code{stat_count()},
give the stat as \code{"count"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the stat, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_stats]{layer stat} documentation.
}}

\item{geom}{The geometric object to use to display the data for this layer.
When using a \verb{stat_*()} function to construct a layer, the \code{geom} argument
can be used to override the default coupling between stats and geoms. The
\code{geom} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item A \code{Geom} ggproto subclass, for example \code{GeomPoint}.
\item A string naming the geom. To give the geom as a string, strip the
function name of the \code{geom_} prefix. For example, to use \code{geom_point()},
give the geom as \code{"point"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the geom, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_geoms]{layer geom} documentation.
}}

\item{position}{A position adjustment to use on the data for this layer. This
can be used in various ways, including to prevent overplotting and
improving the display. The \code{position} argument accepts the following:
\itemize{
\item The result of calling a position function, such as \code{position_jitter()}.
This method allows for passing extra arguments to the position.
\item A string naming the position adjustment. To give the position as a
string, strip the function name of the \code{position_} prefix. For example,
to use \code{position_jitter()}, give the position as \code{"jitter"}.
\item For more information and other ways to specify the position, see the
\link[ggplot2:layer_positions]{layer position} documentation.
}}

\item{center}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, centers the vectors on their respective
grid points.}

\item{normalize}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, normalizes the vectors to unit length.
Set to \code{FALSE} to view the original lengths of the vectors.}

\item{arrow}{Arrow specification, created by \code{grid::arrow()}, to add
arrowheads to vectors.}

\item{fun}{A user-defined function that takes a vector \verb{(x, y)} and returns a
vector \verb{(dx, dy)}, representing the displacements at that point in the vector
field.}

\item{x_lim, y_lim}{Numeric vectors of length 2 specifying the x/y-axis limits for
the grid.}

\item{n}{Integer specifying the number of grid points along each axis
(resolution of the grid).}

\item{show.legend}{logical. Should this layer be included in the legends?
\code{NA}, the default, includes if any aesthetics are mapped.
\code{FALSE} never includes, and \code{TRUE} always includes.
It can also be a named logical vector to finely select the aesthetics to
display.}

\item{inherit.aes}{If \code{FALSE}, overrides the default aesthetics,
rather than combining with them. This is most useful for helper functions
that define both data and aesthetics and shouldn't inherit behaviour from
the default plot specification, e.g. \code{\link[ggplot2:borders]{borders()}}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments passed to \code{layer()}, such as aesthetic mappings.}

\item{na.rm}{If \code{FALSE}, the default, missing values are removed with
a warning. If \code{TRUE}, missing values are silently removed.}
}
\value{
A \code{ggplot2} layer that can be added to a ggplot object to create a
vector field plot. The following mathematical measures are available:
\subsection{Curl}{

The curl represents the rotation or "twisting" of vectors around a point:
\deqn{\text{curl}(\mathbf{f})(x, y) = \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y}}
}

\subsection{Divergence}{

The divergence measures the rate at which vectors "spread out" from a point:
\deqn{\text{div}(\mathbf{f})(x, y) = \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y}}
}

\subsection{Norm}{

The norm (magnitude) of a vector:
\deqn{\|\mathbf{f}(x, y)\| = \sqrt{dx^2 + dy^2}}
}
}
\description{
\code{geom_vector_field} generates a vector field plot layer using a user-defined
function to compute the vector displacements (\code{dx}, \code{dy}) at each grid point.
The function automatically generates a grid of points (specified by \code{x_lim}
and \code{y_lim}) and evaluates the vector displacements at those points.
}
\details{
The user must provide a function that takes a vector \verb{(x, y)} and returns the
\strong{displacements} \verb{(dx, dy)} at that point in the vector field. Optionally, the
layer can compute \strong{divergence}, \strong{curl}, and \strong{vector norm}, which can be
mapped to aesthetics using \code{after_stat()}.

\strong{Default Behavior}:
\itemize{
\item The \strong{magnitude of each vector (\code{norm}) is mapped to the \code{color} aesthetic} by default.
\item \strong{Vector lengths} are scaled to \strong{90\% of the grid spacing}.
\item \strong{Vectors are normalized to unit length} before scaling by grid spacing.
\itemize{
\item \strong{To see the original lengths of the vectors, set \code{normalize = FALSE}.}
}
\item \strong{Arrowheads} are included by default to indicate direction.
}
}
\section{Aesthetic mappings}{

You can map the following measures using \code{after_stat()}:
\itemize{
\item \strong{\code{norm}}: Magnitude (norm) of the vector at each point.
\item \strong{\code{divergence}}: Divergence of the vector field at each point.
\item \strong{\code{curl}}: Curl of the vector field at each point.
}

For example, to map \code{curl} to color:

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{aes(color = after_stat(curl))
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}
}

\examples{
# Example user-defined vector field function
f <- function(v) {
  x <- v[1]; y <- v[2]
  c(x + y, y - x)  # Return displacements (dx, dy)
}

# Create a ggplot with the vector field layer
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(fun = f, x_lim = c(-5, 5), y_lim = c(-5, 5), n = 20)

# Example of mapping norm to length
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(
    aes(length = after_stat(norm)),
    fun = f, x_lim = c(-5, 5), y_lim = c(-5, 5), n = 20,
  )

# Example with both length and curl mapped
ggplot() +
  geom_vector_field(
    fun = f, x_lim = c(-5, 5), y_lim = c(-5, 5), n = 20, normalize = FALSE,
    mapping = aes(length = after_stat(norm), color = after_stat(curl))
  )
